
cascade — it means that the order of CSS rules matter;
 when two rules apply that have equal specificity 
 the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.
 
 In the below example, we have two rules that could apply to the h1.
 The h1 ends up being colored blue — these rules have an identical
 selector and therefore carry the same specificity, so the last one 
 in the source order wins.
 
<!-- 
 example 
 h1 { 
    color: red; 
}
h1 { 
    color: blue; 
}
    
	<h1>This is my heading.</h1> 
	
	
	o/p : in blue color
-->
 
 
 
 
 
Specificity:  Specificity is how the browser decides which rule applies if multiple
  rules have different selectors, but could still apply to the same element.
  It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:

An element selector is less specific — it will select all elements of that
  type that appear on a page — so will get a lower score.
  
A class selector is more specific — it will select only the elements on a
 page that have a specific class attribute value — so will get a higher score.
 
 
<!-- 
 .main-heading { 
    color: red; 
}
        
h1 { 
    color: blue; 
}

<h1 class="main-heading">This is my heading.</h1>

o/p : red color
-->



Inheritance
Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — 
some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited
 by their child elements, and some aren't.

For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, 
every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font,
 unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.
 
 
<!--
 body {
    color: blue;
}

span {
    color: black;
}
    
	
<p>As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through the descendants.</p>
<p>We can change the color by targetting the element with a selector, such as this <span>span</span>.</p>
